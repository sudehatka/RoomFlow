## 🎯 Overview

RoomFlow is not just a standard procedural application; it is a meticulously crafted Object-Oriented Hotel Reservation System. The primary objective is to demonstrate how industry-standard Design Patterns can solve common software architecture problems such as class explosion, rigid pricing, and unsafe state transitions.

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap (Phases)

We are developing this project iteratively using Version Control (Git). The project is divided into 4 core phases:

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Foundation & Factory Pattern (Completed)
The backbone of the system. We established the fundamental rules and object creation mechanisms:
* **Abstraction:** Created the `Room` interface to enforce a strict contract (`getCost`, `getDescription`, `getId`, `getStatus`).
* **Encapsulation:** Secured all room properties (`UUID`, `RoomStatus`) as private fields, accessible only via Getter methods.
* **Factory Pattern:** Implemented a centralized `RoomFactory` to dynamically instantiate `StandardRoom` and `SuiteRoom` objects. This prevents hard-coding and keeps the system open for extension.
* **Polymorphism:** The Main client treats all objects simply as `Room`, allowing dynamic method resolution at runtime.

### 🚧 Phase 2: Dynamic Add-ons (Decorator Pattern)
How do we add services like Open Buffet Breakfast or Spa Access to a room without creating classes like `SuiteRoomWithBreakfastAndSpa`?
* **Goal:** Implement the Decorator Pattern.
* **Outcome:** Services will act as wrappers around base rooms, dynamically recalculating the total cost and description at runtime without altering the core room classes.

### 📅 Phase 3: Status Management (State Pattern)
How do we prevent double-booking safely?
* **Goal:** Implement the State Pattern to replace basic enum checks.
* **Outcome:** Rooms will transition between concrete state objects (`AvailableState`, `OccupiedState`, `CleaningState`). The system will automatically block invalid operations (e.g., trying to book a room that is already `OccupiedState`).

### 📅 Phase 4: Final Assembly & System Testing
* Tying all patterns together in a robust `Main` simulation.
* Comprehensive testing of edge cases.
* Final code clean-up and documentation review.

## 🚀 How to Run

Currently, **Phase 1** is active. To test the core Factory Pattern:
1. Compile the Java files located in the `src` directory.
2. Run the `Main.java` class.
3. Observe the console output demonstrating dynamic room generation and error handling.
